Sudoku Solver
===============================

In **Sudoku**, one is given a 9x9 grid, divided into nine 3x3 "boxes,". Each box has nine "cells," and some of these cells have digits in them - but most are blank. The puzzle is to fill in the rest of the grid so that every row, every column, and every 3x3 box contains the digits 1 through 9. In other words, every row contains all nine digits, every column contains all nine digits, and every box contains all nine digits. This program attempts to solve **Sudoku** puzzles using sets based approach

Puzzles
===============================

In grids there is a number of sudoku problems that the program will read in as list of lists, such as the following:

     [ [ 0, 0, 4,   0, 0, 0,   0, 6, 7 ], 
       [ 3, 0, 0,   4, 7, 0,   0, 0, 5 ], 
       [ 1, 5, 0,   8, 2, 0,   0, 0, 3 ], 
                                          
       [ 0, 0, 6,   0, 0, 0,   0, 3, 1 ], 
       [ 8, 0, 2,   1, 0, 5,   6, 0, 4 ], 
       [ 4, 1, 0,   0, 0, 0,   9, 0, 0 ], 
                                          
       [ 7, 0, 0,   0, 8, 0,   0, 4, 6 ], 
       [ 6, 0, 0,   0, 1, 2,   0, 0, 0 ], 
       [ 9, 3, 0,   0, 0, 0,   7, 1, 0 ] ]
       
       
and will print to terminal as the following representation
    
        +-------+-------+-------+
        | . . 4 | . . . | . 6 7 |
        | 3 . . | 4 7 . | . . 5 |
        | 1 5 . | 8 2 . | . . 3 |
        +-------+-------+-------+ 
        | . . 6 | . . . | . 3 1 |
        | 8 . 2 | 1 . 5 | 6 . 4 |
        | 4 1 . | . . . | 9 . . |
        +-------+-------+-------+
        | 7 . . | . 8 . | . 4 6 |
        | 6 . . | . 1 2 | . . . |
        | 9 3 . | . . . | 7 1 . |

 The following puzzles  be solved by the program:
```
